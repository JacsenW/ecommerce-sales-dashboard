# 🛍️ E-Commerce Sales Dashboard (Python + SQL + Power BI)

Hi, I’m Jacsen — a Data Analyst with a strong focus on data integrity, business intelligence, and solving real problems through clean, scalable systems. This project showcases my ability to take raw e-commerce data and turn it into actionable insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

I built this from scratch, debugged real issues, and documented the full workflow so I can build on it and show others exactly how I think through data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this end-to-end analytics project, I:

- Cleaned raw sales, product, and customer data with **Python (Pandas)**
- Structured and normalized the data into a **SQLite relational database**
- Wrote **SQL queries** to extract KPIs and prepare for reporting
- Created a **fully interactive Power BI dashboard** with slicers, bookmarks, and custom visuals
- Handled real-world data issues and modeled it for clear stakeholder reporting

## ⚙️ Real Problems I Solved

This project had real obstacles. A few examples:

### 🔥 Key Troubleshooting Moments:
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`  
  → Solved by installing dependencies via `pip`
- Missing `.db` file  
  → Realized the script wasn’t saving it properly due to incorrect working directory
- Power BI many-to-many relationship errors  
  → Cleaned duplicate product names and restructured the model
- DAX formula confusion  
  → Broke measures into separate cards for clarity and control
- Slicer formatting limitations  
  → Replaced with buttons and bookmarks for a better user experience

- I work through problems
- I explain what I’ve done
- I use the right tools for the job
